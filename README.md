## Git routines

1. [GITHUB] Create a new issue with your desired task. Use **Labels** to categorize. 
2. [GITHUB] Create a new **branch** out from the main/master branch. 
3. [VSCODE] Do your work in your working branch. 
4. [VSCODE] Push your changes to your working branch. 
5. [GITHUB] Create a pull request to merge the working branch into the main branch. 
6. [BOTH] Resolve any merge conflicts. 
7. [GITHUB] Make sure your issue is closed. This is so the entire team has insight into the project progress. 


## Git Rules 
* We **never** push code directly to the **master** branch. 
* We **never** use commands like "push-f", because that might **destroy** the codebase. 
* Sticking to the integrated git UI in VsCode is usually a good idea -> Less room for error. 
* If you don't know what you are doing, google it or ask someone :))
